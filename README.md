# classconversion README

This is a utility that our team found useful in converting a large number of dot-notated elements in Vue to parentheses-enclosed class attrbutes instead.

## How to use it

Highlight a CSS selector string like .test.class and it will be converted to (class='test class'). Useful for Vue development.
